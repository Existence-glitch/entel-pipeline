This IP address is associated with a Microsoft IIS httpd server version 10.0 running on a Windows system. The following vulnerabilities were found:

1. **WEB-VULN-08**: The "Index Out of Range" Vulnerability. This vulnerability may occur when an index value passed to a function such as `ReadFile` is outside the valid range for the file or stream being operated on, and the application does not handle this error case.

2. **WEB-VULN-19**: The "Smart JavaScript" Vulnerability. This vulnerability occurs when a web server returns a MIME type of `application/x-javascript` for a file that is not a valid JavaScript file, such as an executable or a text file.

3. **WEB-INFO-04**: The "Directory Browsable" Info. This indicates that the web server is set up to allow directory browsing, which could potentially reveal sensitive files or information.

4. **WEB-INFO-02**: The "Weak PHP Configuration" Info. This suggests that the PHP configuration may be weak and could be vulnerable to exploitation.

5. **WEB-INFO-09**: The "Insecure RPC Service" Info. This indicates that there is an insecure Remote Procedure Call (RPC) service accessible, which may lead to unauthorized access or denial of service.

Please review the IP address and these vulnerabilities with your team to determine next steps for further assessment and remediation if necessary.
